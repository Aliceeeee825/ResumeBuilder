# CareerHack Format

## Getting started.

Steps to get started:
1. Fork this repo.
2. Write and push code to your fork.

## Submitting the project

When done, create a pull request against the original repo's `master`. This is your end product. [Here are some examples](https://github.com/MintbeanHackathons/HackTheResume/pulls).

[Adding screenshots to your Pull Request conversation](https://github.com/MintbeanHackathons/HackTheResume/pull/4) is very useful and gets you bonus points.

There is no need to deploy your project.

## Who this Hackathon is for:

This hackathon is for developers of all levels who have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you're a senior developer, this Hackathon provides great mentorship opportunities that can be rewarding for you, as well.

## Why and how this works:

As a community, there are many gaps between academic coding and professional coding. There aren't enough tools or sources of information for developers that help them be successful at their first jobs, or even help them succeed in the hiring cycle and the job application process, the interview process, etc.

Here's the first big difference between academic coding and professional coding:
* In academic coding, you're writing code that will last you for a week, a month, or maybe at max a semester.
* In professional coding, the code you write could be with you for decades. You will also inherit other people's code, possibly written decades ago. And your code will be inherited by others after you. And your coworkers and you will be modifying each other's code over the course of your employments there.

The exercise we will be presenting you will be intentionally simple so that you can focus on writing clean code in a fair amount of time, rather than rushing to make something that looks good on the screen but is a ball of wax in the repo. So, let's not make spaghetti -- we want to make lasagna, nice and layered code that's easy to reason about.

So, in a professional setting, you write code for other people, not just for  the machine, not just for yourself, and not just for the grade. This is something that gets glossed over in academic settings. Collaboration is very rarely taught rigorously and in the right way in schools. 

In CareerHack, we provide developers with information they can use in their own careers. Part of this involves spreading knowledge of best practices and design patterns through code review in Part 2. Another part of it is Q&A and discussions in the chatroom.

This is a solo hackathon for the most part. In the first half, you will be writing code so that others can read it. In the second half, you will be performing code reviews as a group. You will be receiving feedback from others (and possibly from me too) about the code you just wrote, and you will have the opportunity to provide feedback to others as well.

We have a prize on the line. It's a $25 Starbucks gift card, and bragging rights to boot. 

Scoring will be based on:
1. Code quality
2. Feedback provided during code review

Bonus points for:
1. Asking good questions on [r/MintbeanDevChat](https://www.reddit.com/r/MintbeanDevChat)
1. Answering questions on [r/MintbeanDevChat](https://www.reddit.com/r/MintbeanDevChat)

If you don't know what this means -- that's great! You'll learn a lot from the code review process. Just do your best.

And most importantly, have fun!

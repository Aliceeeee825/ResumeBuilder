## Why a standardized data format for résumés is important

Having standardized data formats lets people collaborate on building a better ecosystem of tools. Here are a few examples where this has already happened:

1. The `*.mp3` format allows music creators, streaming companies, software companies, open source tools, and listeners focus on making & sharing great music.
1. The `*.csv` format lets all kinds of software systems talk to each other using imports/exports, while letting human beings retain the ability to clean and format large datasets using tools that understand `*.csv` files.
1. Image formats like `*.png`, `*.jpg`, `*.gif` 
1. The `http` protocol

A standardized résumé format, if one arises, enables many cool things:
* Candidates could automatically apply for 1000's of jobs in bulk.
* Candidates could simple "install" pre-made themes on top of their resume data.
* Candidates would experience less bias in the screening process, because résumé design and writing skills become less important for success.
* Candidates would become much more discoverable, because the structured data allows more efficient sorting/filtering
* Data scientists could run deeper analyses of the job market on well-structured data.
* The community could build advanced tools on top of the résumé format that could enable functionality that we haven't yet thought of.

And there are probably many, many more advantages that aren't listed here.
